TokenBiasDetect: A Python Project for Bias Detection
TokenBiasDetect is my personal first Python project designed to analyze and visualize bias in textual data. The project features a user-friendly local webpage where users can input two different texts and receive a graphical representation of the probability levels of bias present in the texts.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive local webpage for easy text input.
Text Comparison: Input two different texts to compare and analyze for bias.
Bias Detection Algorithm: Utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess and quantify bias in the provided texts.
Graphical Output: Outputs a clear and concise graph that demonstrates the probability levels of bias detected in each text.

How It Works:
Input Texts: The user inputs two different pieces of text into the provided fields on the local webpage.
Analysis: The backend algorithm processes the texts using NLP techniques to detect potential bias.
Visualization: The results are displayed as a graph on the webpage, illustrating the probability levels of bias for each text.

Getting Started:
Clone the Repository: Download the TokenBiasDetect project from the GitHub repository.
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all required Python libraries installed.
Run the Application: Start the local server to launch the webpage.
Input Texts: Enter your texts in the input fields and hit 'Analyze'.
View Results: Examine the generated graph to understand the bias probability levels.

Example Use Case:
Imagine you have two news articles discussing the same event. You want to understand if one article is biased compared to the other. By inputting both articles into TokenBiasDetect, you can quickly visualize and quantify any potential bias, aiding in critical assessment and informed decision-making.
